# Divine Player [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/cameronhunter/divine-player.png)](http://travis-ci.org/cameronhunter/divine-player)

A very simple HTML5 video player that degrades to Flash if necessary.

## Building
You can build the project using `grunt build`. This creates a `release` folder containing the minified javascript and the built SWF player.

## Real Browser Testing
